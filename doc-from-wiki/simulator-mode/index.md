Note, this function was intoduced in MQTTSubscribe version 3.0.

This runs MQTTSubscribe in an environment that is very close to running MQTTSubscribe with WeeWX.
This serves the following purposes.

1. The MQTTSubscribe configuration can be tested prior to updating the configuration (weewx.conf) being used by WeeWX.
2. The MQTTSubscribe configuration can be debugged without having to update the configuration (weewx.conf) being used by WeeWX.
