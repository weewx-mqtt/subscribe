## Installing MQTTSubscribe

Installing MQTTSubscribe put placeholder sections for both MQTTSubscribeDriver and MQTTSubscribeService.
Until additional configuration updates are made, neither of these will run when WeeWX is restarted.
This allows one to install MQTTSubscribe and not 'break' an existing WeeWX installation.
This allows the running MQTTSubscribe in simulation mode to debug prior to running it under WeeWX.

To install version 3.x with WeeWX 5.x see, [Installing and updating version 3.x with WeeWX 5.x](https://github.com/weewx-mqtt/subscribe/blob/master/README.md#initial-installation).

To install version 3.x with WeeWX 4.x see,
[Installing and updating version 3.x with WeeWX 4.x](https://github.com/weewx-mqtt/subscribe/wiki/Installing-and-updating-version-3.x--with-WeeWX-4.x).

To install version 2.x and prior see,
[Installing and Updating Version 2.X and Earlier](https://github.com/weewx-mqtt/subscribe/wiki/Installing-and-updating-version-2.x-and-earlier).
